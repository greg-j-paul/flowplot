# flowplot
The RiverPlot package in R provides excellent capabilities with base R graphics however for I still require more control over how the display looks

Features:
1) Updated to use the ggplot package for rendering 
2) Added display for volumes

Limitations:
1) Currently overlapping volume values are displayed and can look quite bad
